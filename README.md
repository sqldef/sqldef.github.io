# sqldef-wasm

This is a tiny wrapper around the DDL parsing stuff, in wasm.

You can see a demo, [here](https://sqldef.github.io).

It's working mostly ok on the web, but needs some work to be useful on other platforms (it throws errors on node, for example.)

This is basically a place to try out ideas around sqldef & wasm, as the tools mature.

If you're looking for a node library that can do migrations, check out [node-sqldef](https://github.com/sqldef/node-sqldef)
